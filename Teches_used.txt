JWT - JSON Web Tokens for authentication

Header: Encryption algorithm, and type
Payload: Info including user details, expiry date and so on.
Secret: Encode or hash by using the algorithm, stored on the server side (no client side)

Token Authentication
	
	Client sends Username and Password to the server
	Server validates and sends back JWT
	Client sends JWT for further requests
	Server validates JWT and sends back response to the client


Display contents to only authorised users

	Data Annotation [AllowAnonymous] allows any user to see the contents.

	How to test?
		Login then get the token
		Open postman and put Authorization in key section and "Bearer token_you_got_from_login"
			- Make sure there's 1 space inbetween Bearer and your token

How to switch app environment?

	in launchSettings.json, change environment to either "Development" or "Production"
